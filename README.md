## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the `lab3.py` file:
```sh
python lab3.py
```

The script will print out your name, course information, and today's date, followed by details about the U.S. states.

## Features

- Display state name, capital, population, state flower, and associated image.
- Utilizes matplotlib for image handling.
- Organized as a class for easy expansion and maintenance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`
- `datetime`

## Configuration

Ensure that the images for the state flowers are located in the `flowers_lab3` directory. The script references images directly from this directory.

## Examples

Here is a sample output of the script:

```

SDEV 300
2024-08-08
Lab3
State: Alabama
Capital: Montgomery
Population: 4903185
Flower: Camellia
```

The script will also display the associated image of the state flower using matplotlib.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:
- All required libraries are installed.
- The `flowers_lab3` directory contains all necessary images.
